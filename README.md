# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm Pratyusa, I am a Senior Associate at JPMorgan Chase & Co., where I perform model review and validation for asset and wealth management models. I have a PGDM in Business Administration and Management from Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow, and a B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from National Institute of Technology Rourkela. I am also a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and have strong skills in portfolio risk management, statistical data analysis, and Python programming.

In my current role, I have reviewed and validated various types of models, such as alpha generation, asset allocation, glidepath, quantitative factor based tactical asset allocation, risk, and optimisation models. I have also undertaken projects to develop regime indicators for early detection of model performance, benchmark for portfolio risk management dashboard, and predicting quintile level security price using attention based neural network. I enjoy working with diverse and talented teams, and contributing to the enhancement of model governance and quality across the organization. I am passionate about applying my analytical and technical skills to solve complex and challenging problems in the financial sector, and to create value for our clients and stakeholders.
